The problem

Standing up infrastructure in a traditional datacenter where you process work through tickets is slow, inconsistent and hard to scale.

The solution - IaC

>> How do we take the process of 'ClickOps' for standing up infrastructure and codify the process? We do this through IaC.

>> IaC is a practise that enables the creation of infrastructure and services using declarative      configuration files. This allows for a consistent and scalable environment that is fully automated and tracked through version control.

1. Explain what IaC is
>> The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using code

2. Describe advantages of IaC patterns
>> Automation
The click heavy process of standing up infrastructure can now be codified into configuration file, saving large amounts of time
>> Consistency
Our infrastructure should be consistent as we're using an idempotent process to stand it up
>> Scalability
Traditional datacenters with hypervisors had limited scale by nature their manual processes
>> Version control
Who changed what
>> Transparency of documentation
Tracking the changes of the infrastructure over time

>>> Summary >>>

>> What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

 ::The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using code

>> What are the advantages of IaC patterns?

 :: automation,consistency ,scalability, version control

>> What is the purpose of version control in IaC? 

:: It allows for tracking of infrastructure configurations over time

>> How does IaC improve collaboration among teams? 

:: Teams can work together by using a shared, version-controlled codebase for infrastructure management

>> How does IaC provide scalability? 

:: Through automating the provisioning and scaling of infrastructure resources

>> How does IaC provide consistency?

 :: By using infrastructure configurations that are deployed in a repeatable way
