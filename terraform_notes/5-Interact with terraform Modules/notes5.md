## Notes

### **Modules**

*Modules* are containers for multiple resources that are used together. Modules are the main way to reuse resource configurations in Terraform.

There are *root modules* and *child modules*. Child modules are used within root modules.

#### **Calling a child module**

When calling a module, you must pass in values for its input variables. 

```terraform
module "servers" {
  source = "./app-cluster"

  servers = 5
}
```

All modules require a `source` argument, which is a pointer either to the local module, or to a remote module source that Terraform will then download to use.

You must run `terraform init` when adding, removing or modifying modules.

#### **Setting the module version**

When using public modules from a module registry, it's recommended to pass in a `version` argument into the `module` block. This is not required for local modules. 

To update modules, you can run the `terraform get` command.

#### **Accessing module output values**

The resources defined inside a module are encapsulated, so the calling module cannot access them directly, instead you use *output values* to selectively export values to then be used in the calling module.

To reference an output from a module block you can call it with `module.<name>.<output_value>`.

#### **Using input variables**

Each input variable accepted by a `module` must be declared within that `module` using a variable block:

You can force validation on a variable block by using the `validation` block.

```terraform
variable "image_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The id of the machine image (AMI) to use for the server."

  validation {
    condition     = length(var.image_id) > 4 && substr(var.image_id, 0, 4) == "ami-"
    error_message = "The image_id value must be a valid AMI id, starting with \"ami-\"."
  }
}
```

Variables are then used by calling an object named `var`.

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = var.image_id
}
```

When defining variables within a `.tfvar` file, you do not need to build the `variable` block, you only need the variable name assignment:

```terraform
image_id = "ami-abc123"
availability_zone_names = [
  "us-east-1a",
  "us-west-1c",
]
```

#### **Module sources**

The `source` for a module tells Terraform where to find the source code for the module. 

The `source` argument can be treated as a URL, or in special cases you can prefix with actions such as `git::` or `s3::`. If your module is local, you can also pass in a path.

When using modules from the Terraform registry, you can reference the `registry source address` like you would with a provider. `<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`.

#### **Variable scope within modules/child modules**

The root module variables are set using the CLI, environment variables, variable files or in a Terraform Cloud workspace.

When passing variables into the child modules, the calling module passes the variables in using the `module` block.

The outputs defined by the child module will then be accessible in the calling module.

Terraform will automatically pick up files with the name `terraform.tfvars` or `terraform.tfvars.json`, or files ending in `.auto.tfvars` or `.auto.tfvars.json`

Variables defined within modules will not be accessible by their parent module.

## Exam Objectives 

<details>
<summary>Contrast and use different module source options including the public Terraform Module Registry</summary>

- All `module` blocks require a source argument
- This source argument can be a local path, a URL or a special format for module providers like `git`, `s3` buckets and `svn`
- When using a module from the Terraform public registry, you use the format `<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`, which is very similar to a `source address` for a provider
</details>

<details>
<summary>Interact with module inputs and outputs</summary>

- When defining a `module` block, you need to pass in the `source` argument and the inputs required for that module
- The inputs for that module are decided by variables that are used within the `child module`, and are then defined when passed in as input by the calling module
- When `terraform apply` is run, the module will have output that it defines that can then be used by the calling module
</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe variable scope within modules/child modules</summary>

- The root module variables are set using the CLI, environment variables and variable files
- When passing variables into the child modules, the calling module passes the variables in using the `module` block, these variables are then used within the scope of the child module
</details>

<details>
<summary>Set module version</summary>

- When using remote modules, it's recommended that you set the version you're using by passing the `version` argument into the `module`

# Interact with Terraform Modules

What do all `module` blocks require in Terraform? A source argument

What can a source argument be for a module in Terraform? A URL, local path or a registry source address

When importing a module from the Terraform public registry, what do you use as the source? A registry source address `<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`

What are modules in Terraform? They are containers for multiple resources that enable reusability

When adding, removing or modifying modules in Terraform, what do you need to run? `terraform init`

When installing a Terraform module from a module registry, what should you pass in? A version argument

How do you access outputs from a Terraform module? `module.<name>.<output_value>`

When defining a module, what do you need to use to define what inputs can be passed into the module? Variables

When passing variables into the child modules, the calling module passes the variables in how? Arguments in the module block

When accessing a variable in Terraform, what is the prefix? `var.`

The root module variables are set using the {{c1::CLI}}, {{c2::environment variables}}, {{c3::variable files}} or in a {{c4::Terraform Cloud workspace}}.

How would you automatically load in variables from a file in Terraform? Name the file `terraform.tfvars` or `terraform.tfvars.json`, or files ending in `.auto.tfvars` or `.auto.tfvars.json`

When defining variables in a `.tfvar` file, what is the difference? You don't need to include the `variable` block surrounding the variable

The Terraform get command is used for what? To download and update modules
